/**
 * Errors raised by the Kizuna Swift app client.
 *
 * `code` is the stable catalog code an app switches on. It is the value the
 * engine reported, or the code the host itself assigns to a check it makes
 * before the call reaches the engine. The description is always
 * `"CODE: message"`.
 *
 * Six conditions the host raises on its own, with the code each carries:
 *
 * - `CONFIG_INVALID`, `config is not utf8`: the encoded configuration is not
 *   text the engine can read.
 * - `ENGINE_UNAVAILABLE`, `payload is not utf8`: the encoded call payload is
 *   not text the engine can read.
 * - `ENGINE_UNAVAILABLE`, `inspect: expected an object`,
 *   `<method>: unreadable envelope`, or `query: unreadable payload`: the
 *   bridge answered with bytes the client cannot decode, which is the same
 *   class of fault as a missing engine artifact.
 * - `LOCAL_UNSUPPORTED`, `apply requires table and pk`, a builder call the
 *   client records and throws when the read or write runs (`range(<from>, <to>)`,
 *   `filter(...)`, `maxAffected(<n>)`, `select("<embed>")`, `dryRun()`,
 *   `geojson()`, `explain()`, `setHeader(name:value:)`), each message naming
 *   the call and why: a local request the client refuses, the class the kernel
 *   uses for a request it cannot answer.
 *
 * `ATTACHMENT_PORTS_MISSING` and `UNKNOWN_TABLE` are the other two codes the
 * host raises itself. Every remaining code arrives from the engine unchanged.
