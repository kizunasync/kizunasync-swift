# Kizuna Sync for Swift

`KizunaSync` is the Swift app client for [Kizuna Sync](https://kizunasync.com): offline reads and writes on local SQLite, an outbox that syncs through your Supabase project, and typed access to the Rust engine through UniFFI.

## Install

In Xcode choose File → Add Package Dependencies and enter `https://github.com/kizunasync/kizunasync-swift`, or declare the dependency in `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/kizunasync/kizunasync-swift", exact: "0.2.6-alpha.3"),
],
targets: [
  .target(
    name: "App",
    dependencies: [.product(name: "KizunaSync", package: "kizunasync-swift")]
  ),
]
```

```swift
import KizunaSync
```

Platforms: iOS 16 and macOS 13 or later. The package links the prebuilt `KizunaSyncFfi` XCFramework, so the app project needs no Rust toolchain.

Apps use the `KizunaSync` product. `KizunaSyncEngine` exposes only the engine binary, for the React Native module `@kizunasync/rn-uniffi`.
